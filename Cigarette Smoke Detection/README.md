The Cigarette Smoke Detection System is designed with the specific aim of detecting cigarette smoke, a significant health concern for teenagers. The integration of smoke and gas sensors ensures a comprehensive approach to monitoring air quality in spaces frequented by students. The inclusion of the MQ series smoke sensors, sensitive to smoke particles associated with cigarette smoke, aligns with the overarching goal of promoting a smoke-free college environment. The primary goal of the Cigarette Smoke Detection System is to detect and alert users to the presence of cigarette smoke within indoor environments. Educational institutions, especially colleges, strive to maintain a healthy and conducive learning environment. The Cigarette Smoke Detection System plays a pivotal role in supporting these efforts by offering an efficient means to detect cigarette smoke. This not only assists in the enforcement of no-smoking policies within campus premises but also contributes to the overall well-being of students, faculty, and staff.
